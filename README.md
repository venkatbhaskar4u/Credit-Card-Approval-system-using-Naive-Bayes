# Credit Card Approval System using Naive Bayes

## Overview
This project builds a credit card approval prediction system using the Naive Bayes classification algorithm in Python. It analyzes customer application data to predict approval outcomes, demonstrating applied machine learning in a real-world financial context.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for applicant demographic and financial attributes
- Implementation of Naive Bayes classifier for binary approval decision
- Evaluation of model accuracy and performance on test data
- Visualization of key factors influencing approval decisions
- Clear, step-by-step code documentation for learning and reuse

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/venkatbhaskar4u/Credit-Card-Approval-system-using-Naive-Bayes.git`
2. Open `Credit_Card_Approval.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to process data, train the Naive Bayes model, and generate prediction results.
4. Review output visualizations and accuracy metrics in the notebook.

## Results & Example Outputs
- Achieves 80% prediction accuracy on validation data
- Displays confusion matrix and key feature impact plots
- Sample output:
Applicant: Age=35, Income=$50k, Approved? Yes

"An 80% accuracy rate represents realistic performance and avoid overfitting, which is common when training on limited or clean datasets. This provides a more meaningful benchmark for practical deployment."
